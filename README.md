# Team Generator ![License](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=MIT&message=license&color=red)


## Description 
I have created an Node CLI that takes in employee information and generates a Team Profile webpage that displays a summary for each employee. This application can be used by a manager to create an easy to read team snapshot with essential employee information such as role, ID, email, etc.
